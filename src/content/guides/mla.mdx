MLA format, developed by the Modern Language Association, is the go-to citation style for papers in literature, language, and other humanities disciplines. This guide will walk you through the essentials of MLA style, focusing on the latest 9th edition, and equip you with the knowledge to properly cite your sources and format your academic papers.

## Why Use MLA Format?

MLA style provides a standardized system for documenting sources, which offers several benefits:

*   **Consistency:** Ensures a uniform format for citations and paper layout.
*   **Credibility:** Demonstrates academic rigor and acknowledges the work of others.
*   **Clarity:** Allows readers to easily locate and verify the sources you used.
*   **Avoids Plagiarism:** Properly citing sources is crucial for avoiding plagiarism, a serious academic offense.

## Core Elements of MLA Citations

MLA citations, whether in-text or on the Works Cited page, revolve around a set of core elements:

1. **Author.**
2. **Title of source.**
3. **Title of container,**
4. **Other contributors,**
5. **Version,**
6. **Number,**
7. **Publisher,**
8. **Publication date,**
9. **Location.**

Not all elements will be present in every source. The goal is to include the relevant elements in the specified order to help readers identify and locate the source.

## In-Text Citations in MLA

In-text citations briefly identify the source within the body of your paper and point readers to the full citation on the Works Cited page. MLA uses a simple author-page number system:

*   **Basic Format:** (Author's Last Name Page Number)
*   **Example:** (Smith 23)

**Variations:**

*   **Author mentioned in the sentence:** If you mention the author's name in your sentence, only include the page number in the parentheses.

    > Example: Smith argues that the novel is a critique of social norms (23).
*   **No known author:** Use a shortened version of the title in quotation marks.

    > Example: ("Impact of Technology" 42)
*   **Multiple works by the same author:** Include a shortened title to distinguish between the works.

    > Example: (Smith, "Modernism" 15)

## Creating a Works Cited Page in MLA

The Works Cited page is an alphabetized list of all the sources you cited in your paper. It appears at the end of your document. Here's how to format it:

*   **Heading:** Center the title "Works Cited" at the top of the page.
*   **Alphabetical Order:** List entries alphabetically by the author's last name. If no author is listed, alphabetize by the first significant word in the title.
*   **Hanging Indent:** Indent the second and subsequent lines of each entry by 0.5 inches.
*   **Double Spacing:** Double-space the entire Works Cited page.

## Common Source Types and Their MLA Citations

Here are examples of how to cite common source types in MLA format:

### Book

**Format:**

Author's Last Name, First Name. *Title of Book*. Publisher, Publication Date.

**Example:**

## MLA Paper Formatting

In addition to citations, MLA style dictates the overall format of your paper:

*   **Margins:** 1-inch margins on all sides.
*   **Font:** Use a legible font like Times New Roman, 12-point size.
*   **Spacing:** Double-space the entire paper, including the Works Cited page.
*   **Header:** Include a header in the upper right-hand corner of each page with your last name and the page number.
*   **Title Page:** MLA typically does not require a separate title page. Instead, include your name, your instructor's name, the course name, and the date in the upper left-hand corner of the first page, double-spaced. Below this, center the title of your paper.
