## A Quick Guide to Working with Sources

Working with sources is a fundamental aspect of academic writing and research. It involves acknowledging the ideas, information, and words of others that you use in your work. Properly citing sources is crucial for maintaining academic integrity, avoiding plagiarism, and allowing readers to verify your claims and explore further. 

### Why Cite Sources?

Citing sources is not just about following rules; it's about respecting intellectual property and contributing to a scholarly conversation. Here are some key reasons why citations are essential:

*   **Avoiding Plagiarism:** Plagiarism, whether intentional or accidental, is a serious academic offense. It involves presenting someone else's work as your own. By citing your sources, you clearly distinguish between your own ideas and those of others.
*   **Credibility and Authority:** Properly cited sources lend credibility to your work. They demonstrate that your arguments are supported by evidence and that you have engaged with relevant literature.
*   **Transparency and Verifiability:** Citations allow readers to trace the origins of your information and verify your claims. This transparency is crucial for maintaining the integrity of research.
*   **Giving Credit:** Citing sources gives credit where credit is due. It acknowledges the intellectual contributions of others and helps build a community of knowledge.
*   **Further Research:** Citations provide a roadmap for readers who want to delve deeper into a particular topic. They can follow your citations to explore related sources and expand their understanding.

### What Needs to be Cited?

Any information that is not common knowledge or your own original idea should be cited. This includes:

*   **Direct Quotations:** Any time you use the exact words of another author, you must enclose them in quotation marks and provide a citation.
*   **Paraphrases:** When you rephrase someone else's ideas in your own words, you still need to cite the original source.
*   **Summaries:** Even when you condense a longer passage into a brief summary, you must acknowledge the source.
*   **Facts and Statistics:** Data, statistics, and specific facts that are not widely known should be attributed to their source.
*   **Theories and Concepts:** When you discuss the theories, concepts, or frameworks developed by others, proper citation is required.
*   **Images, Tables, and Graphs:** Visual materials created by others must also be cited.

### Popular Citation Styles

Different academic disciplines and publications often prefer specific citation styles. Some of the most common styles include:

*   **MLA (Modern Language Association):** Widely used in the humanities, particularly in literature, language, and cultural studies.
*   **APA (American Psychological Association):** Common in social sciences, education, and psychology.
*   **Chicago/Turabian:** Used in history, art history, and other disciplines.
*   **IEEE:** Often used in engineering and computer science.
*   **Harvard:** A commonly used style across multiple disciplines.
*   **Vancouver:** Often used in medical and scientific fields.

Each citation style has its own specific rules for formatting in-text citations and the bibliography or works cited list. You can learn more about these styles in our [guides](/guides/...).
